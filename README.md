# FE09-wk-2-Maksim-Galimov

Simple markup of freely available template, homework from the course I took. Adaptive/responsive HTML, CSS, JS, JQuerry.

I did it before even having started learning about JS.. Even if you don't know how to use the technology, nothing stops you from googling and copypasting, right?
The code is bit messy, but hey, this was my first try! Why I pushed it anyways if I knew JS-part didn't look that perfect? Because it worked! And because I was able to find solution when I knew nothing about the thing.
